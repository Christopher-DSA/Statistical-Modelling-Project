# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
The goal of this process is to go through the whole data analysis process and answer a question with data.

## Process
### Step 1:
Connecting to CityBikea Api:

Citybikes API: Collect data on the all the bike share rental stations in Toronto, Ontario.
### Step: 2:
cleaning,transforming and parsing the data with Python.
## (your step 3)
Performing EDA, using visualizations and statistics.
## (your step 4)
Identified trends and patterns in the data,
determined the buisness context of the results.
## (intepreted the results of the statistical models)

## Results
Yelp Fusions vs Foursquare api:
When it came to my use casem the yelp fusion api proved to be far superior due to the extra data it could return like the ratings of each restaurant.

The results of my model. I have statistically proven there is no correlation between distance of a bikestop to a bar and the rating of the bar.
(fill in what you found about the comparative quality of API coverage in your chosen area and the results of your model.)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)
Learning the api's was an interesting experience, this project gave me a confidence boost when it comes to learning future api's

Parsing data, the different combinations of dictionries and lists in each json file was at first difficult to work with.

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
 If I had more time I would try different combinations of independent variables vs the rating of the restaurant to see if certian poi's being near a bar actually does
